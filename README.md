# CAM and SeCAM: Explainable AI for Understanding Image Classification Models

## Introduction
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a crucial aspect of AI research, aiming to enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI models. Understanding the decision-making process of AI systems is essential for ensuring trust, accountability, and safety in their applications.
In this tutorial, we focus on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segmentation Class Activation Mapping (SeCAM). Specifically, we consider their application in explaining the decisions of the ResNet50 model, a pivotal architecture within the domain of deep CNNs that has significantly impacted image classification tasks. 
CAM and SeCAM in particular aim to provide fast and intuitive explanations by identifying image regions most influential to the model's prediction.

## Section 1: Overview of XAI Methods
Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of artificial intelligence technology such that the results of the solution can be understood by human experts. It contrasts with the concept of the "black box" in machine learning where even their designers cannot explain why the AI arrived at a specific decision. XAI is becoming increasingly important as AI systems are used in more critical applications such as diagnostic healthcare, autonomous driving, and more.

## Section 2: ResNet50 Architecture and Importance of Understanding
The ResNet50 model is a pivotal architecture within the domain of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has significantly impacted image classification tasks, notably achieving remarkable success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Generally, ResNet50 has the following architecture:

The ResNet50 model, while renowned for its high accuracy in image classification tasks, exemplifies the "black box" nature inherent to many advanced deep learning models. This characteristic poses a significant challenge for AI researchers, practitioners, and end-users who seek to understand the model's predictive behaviour. The intricate architecture of ResNet50, characterised by its deep layers and residual blocks, complicates the interpretation of how input features influence the final classification outcomes

## Section 3: Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
### Definition and Principles
Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is a technique that enables the visualization of which regions in the image are relevant to a particular category according to a convolutional neural network. CAM generates a heatmap for a given image prediction that highlights the important regions used by the CNN for making a decision.

### Implementation on ResNet50
To integrate CAM with ResNet50, it is essential that the network architecture includes a global average pooling layer. Hereâ€™s how you can modify ResNet50 to use CAM:

```python
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense

# Load the pre-trained ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Adding global average pooling layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)

# Adding a fully connected layer
predictions = Dense(1000, activation='softmax')(x)

# Model to be trained
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
```
